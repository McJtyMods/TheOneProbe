1.19-6.2.1:
- New 'blacklistEntities' config (common type). This is a list of entities that will be blacklisted from showing the TOP tooltip. You can specify an entire mod here as well and you can also specify '*' for all entities. Server side this will prevent sending over the needed information for the entity.

1.16-3.0.8:
- Ochotonida: Show the real modname instead of the modid
- migmolrod changed: Show two decimals for horse speed and jump values so breeding is easier and more precise. One decimal is just not enough, specially for speed values since the range between min and max horse speed values is too short (0.1125 to 0.3375) with DecimalFormat rounding making even harder to work with horse breeding. Solves issue #320
- The One Probe now supports showing the current instrument and note for a noteblock
- Fixed a problem with paintings
- Fixed entity rendering in general

1.16-3.0.7:

    - Fix mob spawner's showing an error for the entity type when on servers
    - Fix viewing brewing information of brewing stands
    - Fix a few config options always being reset due to being "invalid". The config system does not fully support non ArrayList defaults, unless you provide a custom element validator
    - Switch from using ByteBuf to PacketBuffer, it is a bit of a mess in the API and has a couple TODOs of things that should be done in 1.16, but in order to keep backwards compat it was needed
    - Send dimension type by registry name rather than int id to ensure that they match on both the client and server

2.0.1:
- Fixed a problem with the itemstack amounts of inventory contents not rendering properly

1.4.33:
- Update to latest Forge

1.4.32:
- Update to 1.14.4

1.4.28:
- Small api method to allow getting the default config

1.4.27:
- Joseph made growth show up for any block with an integer property named "age".

1.4.25:
- More optimal way to send 'pick data' from the client to the server (to avoid overloading the packet limit). TOP now honors the 'share tag' of the item if presnet
- Added a new 'maxPacketToServer' config option (default 20000). If the size of the full NBT of the pick block would exceed this limit it will send over the item without NBT instead

1.4.24:
- Added a new config option ('dontSendNBT') which contains a set of registry names for blocks that don't want their NBT data to be sent from client to server. This is to avoid network packets becoming too large for blocks that have huge itemstacks as a result of 'picking' them

1.4.23:
- Compatible with the latest version of McJtyLib (for big power api)
- Fixed a bug where the one probe would show if a stone block contains a silverfish
- Added the word ‘level’ to the TOP info when a block cannot be harvested to hopefully lessen confusion with this

1.4.23alpha:
- Compatible with the latest version of McJtyLib (for big power api)
- Fixed a bug where the one probe would show if a stone block contains a silverfish
- Added the word ‘level’ to the TOP info when a block cannot be harvested to hopefully lessen confusion with this
