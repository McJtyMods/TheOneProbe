1.16-3.1.4:
- Compatibility fix with IProbeInfo.text()
- Speiger fixed a problem with infinite recursion and invalid values for fluid rendering

1.16-3.1.3:
- Small fix for Forge energy and progressbars in general

1.16-3.1.2:
- Added a new IStyleManager which allows mods to make it easier to manage their styles

1.16-3.1.1:
- Removed usage of AWT.Color in the updated API
- Removed the new static create methods for the various styles in the API because they caused API dependency problems

1.16-3.1.0:
- Show actual note information in addition to just numbers
- If hovering over a player head also show the player name
- VT-14 updated some of the assets to more modern versions
- Various changes from Speiger:
    - Various changes to the api with helper functions for various styles and a few new features
    - Implemented ITextStyle and added many text formatting options
    - More tank rendering options
    - And lots more

1.16-3.0.8:
- Ochotonida: Show the real modname instead of the modid
- migmolrod changed: Show two decimals for horse speed and jump values so breeding is easier and more precise. One decimal is just not enough, specially for speed values since the range between min and max horse speed values is too short (0.1125 to 0.3375) with DecimalFormat rounding making even harder to work with horse breeding. Solves issue #320
- The One Probe now supports showing the current instrument and note for a noteblock
- Fixed a problem with paintings
- Fixed entity rendering in general

1.16-3.0.7:
- Fixed a problem with wolves and iron golems causing massive lag due to log spam
- New 'renderBlacklist' config option that can be used to blacklist entities from rendering (if they have issues with that)

1.16-3.0.6:
- Jais Djurhuus-Kempel fixed TOP so that entity names are also correct if the entity overrides them

1.16-3.0.5:
- Update forge fixing a problem with fluids

3.0.4-beta:
- Fixed a potential exploit which could be used to attack a server

3.0.3-beta:
- Second attempt at fixing players turning heads when someone else looks at them

3.0.2-beta:
- Fixed a bug where some configs were not properly being read
- Fixed a problem on servers where looking at a player would also rotate the head of the player

3.0.1-beta:
- Fix for latest Forge

3.0.0-beta:
- First port of TOP to 1.16 by pupnewfster!

2.0.4:
- New API for using ITextComponent directly in the TOP API. This allows for better translatable messages

2.0.3:
- Fixed a problem when looking at certain entities (like paintings). There would be massive console spam
- Fixed a small problem with IProbeHitEntityData not doing what it promised

2.0.2:
- pupnewfster did various fixes on The One Probe:
    - Fixed checking for empty liquids
    - Fix mob spawner's showing an error for the entity type when on servers
    - Fix viewing brewing information of brewing stands
    - Fix a few config options always being reset due to being "invalid". The config system does not fully support non ArrayList defaults, unless you provide a custom element validator
    - Switch from using ByteBuf to PacketBuffer, it is a bit of a mess in the API and has a couple TODOs of things that should be done in 1.16, but in order to keep backwards compat it was needed
    - Send dimension type by registry name rather than int id to ensure that they match on both the client and server

2.0.1:
- Fixed a problem with the itemstack amounts of inventory contents not rendering properly

1.4.37:
- Show localized names for fluids
- Fixed tracing so that non-opaque blocks are visible in TOP too (like grass, ferns, flowers, ...)
- Liquids now show correctly
- Right clicking the probe will show the config gui again

1.4.36:
- Re-implemented /top config command (previously /topcfg)
- Re-implemented /top need command (previously /topneed)

1.4.34:
- Worked around a vanilla bug with foxes. This bug affects rendering of the fox client-side and also affects the vanilla mob spawner (https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-148893). Worked around it by catching the crash and simply not rendering the fox in the tooltip

1.4.33:
- Update to latest Forge

1.4.32:
- Update to 1.14.4

1.4.28:
- Small api method to allow getting the default config

1.4.27:
- Joseph made growth show up for any block with an integer property named "age".

1.4.25:
- More optimal way to send 'pick data' from the client to the server (to avoid overloading the packet limit). TOP now honors the 'share tag' of the item if presnet
- Added a new 'maxPacketToServer' config option (default 20000). If the size of the full NBT of the pick block would exceed this limit it will send over the item without NBT instead

1.4.24:
- Added a new config option ('dontSendNBT') which contains a set of registry names for blocks that don't want their NBT data to be sent from client to server. This is to avoid network packets becoming too large for blocks that have huge itemstacks as a result of 'picking' them

1.4.23:
- Compatible with the latest version of McJtyLib (for big power api)
- Fixed a bug where the one probe would show if a stone block contains a silverfish
- Added the word ‘level’ to the TOP info when a block cannot be harvested to hopefully lessen confusion with this

1.4.23alpha:
- Compatible with the latest version of McJtyLib (for big power api)
- Fixed a bug where the one probe would show if a stone block contains a silverfish
- Added the word ‘level’ to the TOP info when a block cannot be harvested to hopefully lessen confusion with this
