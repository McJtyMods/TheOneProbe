Upcoming:
- Fixed a problem when looking at certain entities (like paintings). There would be massive console spam
- Fixed a small problem with IProbeHitEntityData not doing what it promised

2.0.2:
- pupnewfster did various fixes on The One Probe:
    - Fixed checking for empty liquids
    - Fix mob spawner's showing an error for the entity type when on servers
    - Fix viewing brewing information of brewing stands
    - Fix a few config options always being reset due to being "invalid". The config system does not fully support non ArrayList defaults, unless you provide a custom element validator
    - Switch from using ByteBuf to PacketBuffer, it is a bit of a mess in the API and has a couple TODOs of things that should be done in 1.16, but in order to keep backwards compat it was needed
    - Send dimension type by registry name rather than int id to ensure that they match on both the client and server

2.0.1:
- Fixed a problem with the itemstack amounts of inventory contents not rendering properly

1.4.37:
- Show localized names for fluids
- Fixed tracing so that non-opaque blocks are visible in TOP too (like grass, ferns, flowers, ...)
- Liquids now show correctly
- Right clicking the probe will show the config gui again
- The keybindings work again
- Block breaking progress shows again
- The probe note item is back!

1.4.36:
- Re-implemented /top config command (previously /topcfg)
- Re-implemented /top need command (previously /topneed)

1.4.34:
- Worked around a vanilla bug with foxes. This bug affects rendering of the fox client-side and also affects the vanilla mob spawner (https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-148893). Worked around it by catching the crash and simply not rendering the fox in the tooltip

1.4.33:
- Update to latest Forge

1.4.32:
- Update to 1.14.4

1.4.28:
- Small api method to allow getting the default config

1.4.27:
- Joseph made growth show up for any block with an integer property named "age".

1.4.25:
- More optimal way to send 'pick data' from the client to the server (to avoid overloading the packet limit). TOP now honors the 'share tag' of the item if presnet
- Added a new 'maxPacketToServer' config option (default 20000). If the size of the full NBT of the pick block would exceed this limit it will send over the item without NBT instead

1.4.24:
- Added a new config option ('dontSendNBT') which contains a set of registry names for blocks that don't want their NBT data to be sent from client to server. This is to avoid network packets becoming too large for blocks that have huge itemstacks as a result of 'picking' them

1.4.23:
- Compatible with the latest version of McJtyLib (for big power api)
- Fixed a bug where the one probe would show if a stone block contains a silverfish
- Added the word ‘level’ to the TOP info when a block cannot be harvested to hopefully lessen confusion with this

1.4.23alpha:
- Compatible with the latest version of McJtyLib (for big power api)
- Fixed a bug where the one probe would show if a stone block contains a silverfish
- Added the word ‘level’ to the TOP info when a block cannot be harvested to hopefully lessen confusion with this
